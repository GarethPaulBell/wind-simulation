    " ### Boundary Labels:\n",
    "- The boundaries of the simulation box are denoted as follows:\n",
    "  - **N**: North\n",
    "  - **S**: South\n",
    "  - **E**: East\n",
    "  - **W**: West\n",
    "  - **T**: Top\n",
    "  - **B**: Bottom\n",
    "\n",
    "### Voxel Space Orientation:\n",
    "- **z-axis**: Represents the first dimension of the voxel space.\n",
    "- **y-axis**: Represents the second dimension, with the 0th position being north.\n",
    "- **x-axis**: Represents the third dimension, with the 0th position being to the west.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wind Direction and Boundary Conditions:\n",
    "The simulation accounts for wind blowing horizontally at specific compass bearings, leading to 8 distinct cases for setting boundary conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cases 0 to 3** (Cardinal Directions): Wind at 0째 (N), 90째 (E), 180째 (S), 270째 (W). One boundary in either the xz or yz plane will have a specified velocity, either positive or negative, corresponding to the wind direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cases 4 to 7** (Inter-Cardinal Directions):\n",
    "  - **NE quadrant**: Positive y-velocity (vy), Negative x-velocity (vx)\n",
    "  - **SE quadrant**: Negative y-velocity (vy), Negative x-velocity (vx)\n",
    "  - **SW quadrant**: Negative y-velocity (vy), Positive x-velocity (vx)\n",
    "  - **NW quadrant**: Positive y-velocity (vy), Positive x-velocity (vx)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross Section and Land Boundaries:\n",
    "- The landscape is represented within the voxel space, dividing the box's cross-section into areas of land and clear air.\n",
    "- The interaction between the wind and the landscape introduces variations in boundary conditions across different parts of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question on Boundary Conditions:\n",
    "1. **Non-slip Conditions for Land Voxels**: Can all land voxels be treated as non-slip conditions to simulate the interaction with the wind accurately?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed Boundary Condition Implementation:\n",
    "- **Wind Incident Borders**: For borders facing the direction of the incoming wind, apply constant velocity boundaries to simulate the wind entering the simulation space.\n",
    "- **Do Nothing for the Ceiling**: The top boundary (ceiling) of the simulation box does not directly influence the wind simulation and may be treated as a 'do nothing' condition.\n",
    "- **Remaining Borders and Air Spaces**: For parts of the box not defined as land or directly affected by the incoming wind, apply 'Do Not Care' or appropriate boundary conditions to simulate the natural behavior of air flow around and over the landscape.\n"
